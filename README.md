# Task-Manager

This project is a final application of what I learned in a JavaScript course. The HTML and CSS files were provided, but I made some adjustments to them. The main goal of this project was to practically apply JavaScript concepts, and also to learn how to connect the front-end to the back-end, a feature which is still under development.
